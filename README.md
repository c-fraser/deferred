# deferred

A compiler plugin to enable [defer statements](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Defer_statements) in
the [Kotlin programming language](https://kotlinlang.org/).

> Dissimilar to Go's `defer` statements, currently, function deferral only works within a *block body*.

## Acknowledgements

Kudos to the [kotlin-power-assert](https://github.com/bnorm/kotlin-power-assert) project which
significantly influenced the implementation of `deferred`.
